## Overview

TypeIt is the most versatile, user-friendly jQuery animated typing plugin on the planet. In simple use, it allows you to type single or multiple strings that break lines, delete & replace each other, and it even handles HTML tags &amp; entities. 

For more advanced, controlled typing effects, TypeIt comes with companion functions that can be chained to tweak your typing down to the smallest character, enabling you to type not just a few strings of text, but an entire narrative, with complete control over speed, characters, line breaks, deletions, pauses, everything.

### Some of the Perks
* Choose to start typing only when your element becomes visible on the screen. 
* Loop your string(s) continuously.
* Define you strings via JSON or in the HTML (useful in case user doesn't have JavaScript enabled).
* Create several unique instances on a single page.
* Handle HTML tags (including those with classes, ID's, etc.) and entities with ease.
* Use companion functions to chain individual commands together to fine tune your typing. 
* Supported by jQuery 1.8.0 or higher.
* Lightweight. (~5kb, single JavaScript file)

## Setup

### Get the Code

Get it from this repo, or from the following sources: 

* <strong><a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/jquery.typeit">CDN:</a></strong> Include  `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.typeit/4.3.0/typeit.min.js` or `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/typeit/4.3.0/typeit.min.js` on your page.
* <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/typeit">npm:</a></strong> Install with `npm install typeit`.

### Hook It Up

1. Load jQuery and typeit.js on your page.

  ```html
  <script src="jquery.js"></script>
  <script src="typeit.js"></script>
  ```
  
2. Create an empty HTML element to select. (If you want to have a fallback for users without JavaScript, you can put a string or strings right into this element. For more on that, see the <a href="http://macarthur.me/typeit/docs">full documentation</a>.)

  ```html
  <span class="type-it"></span>
  ```

You're ready to start typing!

## Simple Usage

In it's simplest use, just call `typeIt()` on any element and include your [options](#options).

Example: 

```js
  $('.type-it').typeIt({
    strings: ['Enter your string here!', 'Another string!']
  });
```

## Advanced Usage
To control your typing down to the smallest character, there are five companion functions available to use. Simply chain them together following a typeIt() call on an element, and your chain will execute. You can define your global settings within the function call like usual, and can even change settings on the fly throughout the chain. 

For example:

```js
  $('.type-it').typeIt({
    speed: 900,
    lifeLike: false,
    autoStart: false
  })
  .tiType('I am typing slowly,')
  .tiSettings({speed: 100})
  .tiType('but now I am typing pretty fasst')
  .tiDelete(2)
  .tiType('t!');
```

### Companion Functions

| tiType() | (string) Characters (including those wrapped in HTML) to be typed. | Will type the characters. |
| tiDelete() | (number) Number of characters to be deleted from what's already been typed. | Will delete the specified number of characters. |
| tiEmpty() | (none) | Will instantly delete everything that has already been typed.
| tiPause() | (number) Number of milliseconds to pause before continuing. | Will pause the specified number of milliseconds.|
| tiBreak() | (none) | Will break the typing to a new line.|
| tiSettings() | (JSON) Options you'd like to update | Will redefine your options on the fly. This will only work for updating the `speed`, `lifeLike`, and `html` options.|



## Options
